Hi, I'm @aaroncapron. You can call me Aaron || AC

    - I'm currently learning Java && Discrete Math at my university, UTEP
    
    - Some of my interests include learning code in my free time to further my skillbase
    
    - Outside of school, I like to play games like Rust and Minecraft as they often involve a bit of coding in their own ways
    
    - Feel free to contact me via adcapron@miners.utep.edu
