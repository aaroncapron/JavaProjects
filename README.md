/*  - Hi, I'm @aaroncapron. You can call me Aaron or AC, whichever you feel comfortable with
    - I'm currently learning Java && Discrete Math at my university, UTEP.
    - Some of my interests include {learning code in my free time and adopting code online and making it my own to understand it}
    - Outside of school, I like to play games like Rust and Minecraft as they often involve a bit of coding in their own ways
    - Feel free to contact me via adcapron@miners.utep.edu
